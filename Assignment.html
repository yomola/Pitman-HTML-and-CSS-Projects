			Cockroaches are one of the hardiest insects that have survived on this planet for millions of years. They thrive in unhygienic environments, are able to survive without food for up to 30 days, without air for around 45 min and being submerged under water for 30 min. Cockroaches are omnivorous and feed on a variety of foods, including cellulose and plastic, to name a few. It is intriguing that cockroaches are able to endure and flourish under conditions that are harmful to Homo sapiens.
